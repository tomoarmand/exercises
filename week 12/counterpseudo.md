1. In HTML, create an input field and two separate display fields and give each a class and ID.
2. In JS, get a reference to each of the elements and store them in variables.
3. In the first field, display the number of words in the textfield.
4. In the second field, display the numbers of characters in the textfield. 
5. Achieve this by creating a variable which contains the text string from the textfield.  Use .split(" ") to find the number of words in the string, and .split("") to find the number of characters in the string.
6. Display the numbers in the respective fields.
